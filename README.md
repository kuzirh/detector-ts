# Detector-ts

## Project Overview

Detector is a mobile software solution with integrated object detection AI. The goal of Detector is to release something that another
software engineer or company can take and use to deliver value with in their own line of work. Detector will host a couple of key features, I am just focusing on getting a working product and I care more about the Machine Learning that will be built into the product, and not so much how the app looks per se.

### Features:

- ~~Ability to turn on the camera~~ (OBE)
- [x] Ability to use the Camera (Complete)
- Ability to use the camera to detect an object in frame (different than identifying the object)
- Ability to identify the detected object
- Ability to take a photo of the identified object

### Installation

After forking or cloning the project, there are some things that you will want to do as a developer in order to get the project running in your environment.

1. Do an `npm install` at the root of the project
1. Download the `Expo` application either on your apple or android device. The project can also be ran on web but the whole point of this repo is for mobile object detection so I wouldn't.
1. In the terminal run, `expo start`, this will start building the project for you.
1. After running the above command a web browser will open, this is the expo debug browser. From here you will se a QR code (You can also find the QR code in the terminal where you ran `expo start`).
1. Navigate to the expo application on your movile device, and hit the `Scan QR Code` button, then scan the QR code.
1. Once you have scanned the QR code, the project will begin to build on your phone.
1. When the build process is done, you will be free to navigate through the application on your mobile device.
